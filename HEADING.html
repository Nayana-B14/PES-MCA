Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft. 
It is used to develop computer programs including websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. 
Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms including Windows API, Windows Forms. 
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Microsoft Store and Microsoft Silverlight. 
<b><h3>It can produce both native code and managed code.</h3></b>
Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring. 
<del>The integrated debugger works as both a source-level debugger and as a machine-level debugger. </del>
Other built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class designer. 
and database schema designer. It accepts plug-ins that expand the functionality at almost every levelâ€”including adding support. 
for source control systems (like Subversion and Git) and adding new toolsets like editors and visual designers for. 
<enum>domain-specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software development lifecycle. </enum>
(like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer).
Support for programming languages is added by using a specific VSPackage called a Language Service. 
A language service defines various interfaces which the VSPackage implementation can implement to. 
add support for various functionalities.[13] Functionalities that can be added this way include syntax coloring.
statement completion, brace matching, parameter information tooltips, member lists, and error markers for background compilation.
If the interface is implemented, the functionality will be available for the language. 
Language services are implemented on a per-language basis. 
The implementations can reuse code from the parser or the compiler for the language.
Language services can be implemented either in native code or managed code. 
For native code, either the native COM interfaces or the Babel Framework.
 (part of Visual Studio SDK) can be used.
For managed code, the MPF includes wrappers for writing managed language services.
The instances are launched by an AppId-specific .exe that selects the AppId, sets the root hive, and launches the IDE. 
VSPackages registered for one AppId are integrated with other VSPackages for that AppId. 
The various product editions of Visual Studio are created using the different AppIds. 
The Visual Studio Express edition products are installed with their own AppIds, but the Standard, Professional, and Team.
Suite products share the same AppId. Consequently, one can install the Express editions side-by-side with other editions.
unlike the other editions which update the same installation.
<u>The AppId system is leveraged by the Visual Studio Shell in Visual Studio 2008.</u>
